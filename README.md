# RSA-Project
Private/Public key encryption for Algorithms

** Project due 9/24 @ 11:59
-- We must use extended version of GCD for full points
-- Must have a GCD of 1 in order to have a inverse
-- Character wise encryption is okay but block wise is also an option
-- We need to have good front end and back end
    -- Design interaction will matter
    -- Refer to flow charts
-- prime number must be over 1 million
